# CecropiaTest

Hello!
This is the technical test I developed following the instructions.
I tried to follow most of the parameters, I didn't managed to get enough free time to finish everything, there are some optimizations that can be done, and some refactoring, but in general I think it's a good enough approach to show some of my skills.
Since my current work and personal life didn't let me spend 8 straight hours to develop the test, I worked on it 3 hours on Thursday and 4 hours on Friday, I hope you can evaluate my skills from this.
This was my first time developing a test for a company, I was hired only with an interview in my previews jobs, any comment or suggestion you can have, I would really appreciate it.

Have fun!
